"Interpolates between two 3D curves or trajectories).

<steps> is the number of interpolated curves wanted, including <first> and <second>.
  1 means one value between <first> and <seconds>.
  2 will return only <first> and <second>.
  3 will return <first> and <second> with one more curve in between.
  etc.

<curve> in an exponential factor for the interpolation curve (0 = linear).

<decimals> is the precision (number of decimals) in the returned curves (default NIL = precision of <first>).

<mode> determines how interpolation is done :
 - 'points is point-by-point interpolation: the curves must have the same number of points, or the bigger one will be truncated.
 - 'sample means that the curves are resampled before interpolation. In case of BPfs, x-points will be added if needed so that the interpolated curves all have the same x points. In case of BPCs, the one with fewer points is resampled, then point-by-point interpolation is applied.

Outputs
 1) list of interpolated BPFs/BPCs
 2) list of x-points
 3) list of y-points
 4) list of z-points
 5) list of times
