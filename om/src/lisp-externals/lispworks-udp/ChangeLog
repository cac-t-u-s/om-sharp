API Changes between 1.x and 2.x:

* [START-UDP-SERVER] Second argument of UDP-SERVER-LOOP changed

  Now we bind UDP client's address and port to special variable:
	*client-address*, *client-port*, and simply UDP-SERVER-LOOP's
	second arguent to ftype: (function (sequence) sequence). So we
	can just use #'identity to implement a UDP echo server:

  (COMM:START-UDP-SERVER :FUNCTION #'IDENTITY ...)

* [START-UDP-SERVER] New :ARGUMENTS keyword

	Now START-UDP-SERVER has a new :ARGUMENTS keyword, you can pass values into
	this keyword argument as LIST, and these values will be called with your
	UDP message processing function.

API Changes between 2.x and 3.x:

* (3.0) [SYNC-MESSAGE] High-level UDP message send/recv function with
	retransmit support.

* (3.1) Require Multi-Processing function: MP:WITH-LOCK

* (3.1) MAX-BUFFER-SIZE keyword in SEND-MESSAGE is obsolete.

* (3.3) The SERVICE keyword in START-UDP-SERVER has changed its default
	value to 0 (zero), which means a dry call (START-UDP-SERVER)
	will listen on random free (unused) port.

API Changes between 3.x and 4.x:

* Change from COMM package to COMM+ package!!! (all external symbols of COMM is also exported to COMM+)

* Add support for UNIX Domain socket (both stream and datagram, but no server support)
  Related new functions: OPEN-UNIX-STREAM, OPEN-UNIX-SOCKET, CONNECT-TO-UNIX-PATH

* New class (INET-DATAGRAM and UNIX-DATAGRAM), both subclass of SOCKET-DATAGRAM

* new funcion CLOSE-DATAGRAM instead of CLOSE-SOCKET

* [API Change] SEND-MESSAGE and RECEIVE-MESSAGE's optional arguments become keyword arguments

* [API Change] RECEIVE-MESSAGE's 3rd return value (remote-address) is a 32bit integer now,
  If you want to string-like IPv4 address, call COMM:IP-ADDRESS-STRING yourself.

* [API Change] SET-SOCKET-RECEIVE-TIMEOUT and GET-SOCKET-RECEIVE-TIMEOUT change name to
               SOCKET-RECEIVE-TIMEOUT and (SETF SOCKET-RECEIVE-TIMEOUT)

* [4.1] SO_REUSEADDR support, new function SOCKET-REUSE-ADDRESS and (SETF SOCKET-REUSE-ADDRESS)

* [4.1] UDP Multicast Support (only on non-win32 platform)

  Add new keyword argumets to START-UDP-SERVER:

  + MULTICAST (default NIL), set it to T will enable a multicast server.
  + MCAST-LOOP (default T), IP_MULTICAST_LOOP, local loopback of multicast datagrams.
  + MCAST-TTL (default 1), IP_MULTICAST_TTL, hop limit for outgoing multicast datagrams.
  + MCAST-INTERFACE (default 0, equal to "0.0.0.0"), the interface for outgoing
    multicast datagrams sent on this socket. (You should get the address of each
    interface by other method, currently no API can list all interface addresses
    of host OS)

  New funtions:

  + MCAST-JOIN
  + MCAST-LEAVE
  + MCAST-LOOP and (SETF MCAST-LOOP),
  + MCAST-TTL and (SETF MCAST-TTL),
  + MCAST-INTERFACE and (SETF MCAST-INTERFACE),
