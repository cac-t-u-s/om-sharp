      "Returns the <n>th element in <list>.
The count starts from 0, i.e. (nth 0 list) is the first element of the list.

Ex. (nth 0 '(1 2 3 4 5 6)) ==> 1
Ex. (nth 2 '(1 2 3 4 5 6)) ==> 3")

Ex. (butlast '(1 2 3 4 5 6)) ==> (1 2 3 4 5)
Ex. (butlast '(1 2 3 4 5 6)) ==> (1 2 3)")

(setf (documentation 'reverse 'function)

Ex. (list 1 2 'a 7) ==> (1 2 a 7)


LIST also exists as a type specifier (or class).
The type specifier is mainly used to set types in other class slots or method arguments.

(setf (documentation 'remove 'function)
      "Returns a new sequence that has the same elements as <sequence> except those that satisfy the test <test> with <item>.
By default the test is 'eql so the items that are equal to <item> are removed.

<test> can be a function or a function name.
<start> and <end> determine bounding indices in the original sequence for removing elements.
<count> allows to specify a maximal number of items to remove.
<from-end> if T, starts removing items from end of the sequence
<key> is a function applyed to each item before to be tested
<test-not> is used to remove elemet that do not satistfy the test (deprecated use)

Ex. (remove 5 '(2 5 6 7 5 3)) ==> (2 6 7 3)
Ex. (remove 5 '(2 5 6 7 5 3) :test '>) ==> (2 3)
Ex. (remove 5 '((b 2) (c 5) (d 6) (e 7) (f 5) (g 3))) :key 'second) ==> ((b 2) (d 6) (e 7) (g 3))

      "Creates a new CONS with <car> and <cdr>.
A CONS is a basic compound data object having two components called the CAR and the CDR
A LIST is recursively defined as a CONS which CDR is a list.

Ex. (cons 'a 'b) ==> (a . b)
Ex. (cons 'a nil) ==> (a)
Ex. (cons 'a '(b c)) ==> (a b c)
Ex. (cons 'a (cons 'b nil)) ==> (a b)")

<function> is a function or function name.
<arg> is a list of arguments.

Ex. (apply '+ '(3 4)) ==> 7

      "Applies <function> to <args>.

<function> is a function or function name.
<args> are the arguments.

<function> can be a function or function name. It is applied to the first element of each list, then to the second element of each list, and so on.

The value returned is a list of the results of successive calls to <function>.")

<function> can be a function or function name. It is applied to the first element of each list, then to the second element of each list, and so on.

The value returned is a the concatenation of the results of successive calls to <function>. <function> should therefore return lists.")

T can be used as a type specifier in class slots or method arguments in order to describe any object type (all objects inherit from the Lisp class 'T').")

This class is mainly used to set types in other class slots or method arguments.")

FLOAT exists in Lisp as a functions, which converts its input (a real number) to a float number.

STRING exists in Lisp as a functions, which converts its input (another string, a symbol or a character) into a string.
Ex. (string 'hello) => \"hello\"

It also exists as a type specifier (or class).
The type specifier is mainly used to set types in other class slots or method arguments.

Strings are represented as characters between double-quotes (\"\").

(setf (documentation 'null 'function)
      "In Common Lisp, NIL, also notated '(), represents the empty list.

The function NULL tests if something is equal to NIL or not.
This function returns T if the argument is NIL, and NIL if not.

Ex. (null 4) => NIL
Ex. (null NIL) => T
Ex. (null '()) => T
Ex. (null '(5 6 7)) => NIL

NULL is also the name of a class (the 'class of NIL'), and can be used to specialize method arguments.")
