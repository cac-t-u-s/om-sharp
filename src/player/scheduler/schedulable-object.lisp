SCHEDULABLE OBJECT: an object to be played through a SCHEDULER.
=======================================================================

Any subtype of schedulable-object is playable.
For a proper use, some methods have to be redefined:

1) The method (get-action-list-for-play ((self OBJECT-CLASS) time-interval)).
This method will ask the object what has to be played in [(car time-interval);(cadr time-interval)[.
The output has to be:
.((Date1 Function1 Data1) ... (DateN FunctionN DataN)) where DateN is the date in ms when FunctionN has to be called with DataN as a list of arguments (NIL if no arguments needed),
.NIL if nothing has to be played (no item to play found in time-interval).

2) The method (get-computation-list-for-play ((self OBJECT-CLASS) time-interval)).
This method will ask the object what has to be computed in [(car time-interval);(cadr time-interval)[.
The output has to be:
.((Date1 Deadline1 Function1 Data1) ... (DateN DeadlineN FunctionN DataN)) where DateN is the date in ms when FunctionN is allowed to be performed and Deadline1 is the date in ms when the result has to be produced,
.NIL if nothing has to be computed.

3) The method

3) Every modification on the data used by the previous methods has to be wrapped in the macro (with-schedulable-object object &rest body).
If the use of a macro is not convenient, you can simple call (notify-scheduler object) each time you think rescheduling might be useful."))
