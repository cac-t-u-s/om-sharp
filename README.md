This project is an experimental implementation of the OpenMusic visual programming and computer-aided composition environment, developed for research purpose and including a number of improvements in terms of graphical interface, computational possibilities, and compositional affordance in general.

At the moment it is not meant to replace OpenMusic and lacks a number of important features to do so. OM6 is the official version : https://forge.ircam.fr/p/OM/
